This is a travel website which has a very unique JavaScript 3D parallax effect. Build with HTML, CSS & JS

I used three additional resources to get this parallax effect. Huge thanks to @developedbyed for tutoring this to me.

The CDNs from [https://greensock.com](https://greensock.com) -
  * [https://greensock.com/tweenmax/](https://greensock.com/tweenmax/) - TweenMax lets you animate literally any property of any object that JavaScript can touch (CSS, SVG, React, Vue, Three.js, canvas, motion paths, generic objects, etc.).
  * [https://scrollmagic.io/](https://scrollmagic.io/) - ScrollMagic helps you to easily react to the user's current scroll position. Basically combine with the above and helps in scroll animation.
  * [https://greensock.com/scrollmagic/](https://greensock.com/scrollmagic/) - A GSAP plugin to allow ScrollMagic to take control of your tweens
